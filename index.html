            <h4>
                The world was introduced to the term Corona Virus at the very end of 2019, following which everyone was
                thrown into stress and anxiety of what this deadly virus was capable of and how long before it reached
                them.
                Since then, the doctors have been trying to find a cure relentlessly. But it was only a matter of a few
                weeks when they realized that they were not against some typical virus, but a highly contagious deadly
                disease which was spreading across thousands of people every day all around the globe. A state of
                emergency
                was declared everywhere, and wearing face masks was made a must for people to move out of their
                homes.<br>
